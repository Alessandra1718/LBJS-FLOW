  // time sleep 1 hour - testing for 5 seconds  
  // connect the capacitative sensor
  // check in on plant and the readings 
  // large if statement ( can this be optimized?)(into a separate function?) on different readings in sensor : their results 
  // this will need a separate dataset ( file?) to test different soil moisture levels and determine which is which 
  // take measurements and make a data table sample of differnt measurmemts 
  // code in peices: 
  // - pump running when called on (function)
  // - measurments of moisture sensor (function separately)
  // - add connections to wifi module/serial input -> later website 
  // - lED light up (debug) or some sort of power mitigation circuit 
  //other platforms ( future) : add connection to serial print onto a website, add wifi/bluetooth module 
  // add access for phones and other ways to see this information ( once the first is sucessfull)
