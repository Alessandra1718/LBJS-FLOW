# Project BLOOM
This is our STEM Senior Engineering year-long Capstone Project. We aim to create an automated watering system for houseplants, powered by an Arduino Uno Rev3. Any code for this project will be periodically uploaded, depending on how far we make it. 

I am working with three other teamates however all work will be uploaded here (by me ) as they do not have github accounts ( yet! ) 
Most of the code will be written in replit, Arduino IDE or an arduino online simulator such as Wokwi or TinkerCad, updated weekly
